# Odin Recipes
This is my first HTML project from The Odin Project.

Big things this project handled were:
- Basic HTML document structure
- Using common html tag types
- Linking between pages
- Adding images

A lot of this was review from the several times I've tried picking up Web Development. But a refresher is never bad. Right?

If you're seeing this, you're on the *stylish* branch. Meaning I'm going to probably make this look like some hot trash with CSS.
